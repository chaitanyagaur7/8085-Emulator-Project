# 8085-Emulator-Project

This is a Python project that simulates the functioning of the 8085 microprocessor. The 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was introduced by Intel in 1977. It was widely used in the 1980s in various applications such as personal computers, calculators, and embedded systems. The emulator is capable of executing a range of 8085 instructions and supports input and output operations.

# Features
* Supports various 8085 instructions
* Supports input and output operations
* Includes a debugger mode for step-by-step execution
* Handles invalid input and file errors
